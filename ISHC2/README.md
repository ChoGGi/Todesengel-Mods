# ISHC2 (2.3.x)

The Interstellar Habitation Coalition has approved the necessary funding for the Mars Colony Habitation Project. This funding grants you the necessary equipment to indefinitely sustain a colony on Mars. This funding has drastically reduced the building cost for your first starter Dome however; due to the basic blueprints the upkeep has slightly been increased. The Coalition has provided unlockable blueprints and urges you to develop improved habitats at your earliest convenience.

# OT's Essentials

Contains stuff needed by most of my mods.
The load order for my library in relation to my mods should not be an issue.
Reason for this mod: I got tired of copying and pasting functions between different mods to update them, now I just update this mod for those functions.

# Domes 

- Tier 1: Emergency Dome â€“ Starts unlocked

- Tier 2: Medium Dome - Can be built once the Medium Dome has been researched (Low G Engineering).

- Tier 3: Mega Dome - Can be built once the Mega Dome has been researched (Gravity Engineering).

- Tier 4: Oval Dome - Can be built once the Oval Dome Breakthrough has been researched (Multispiral Architecture) or (Localized Terraforming Technology).

- Tier 5: Geoscape Dome - Can be built once the Geoscape Dome has been researched (Localized Terraforming Technology).

## Oxygen Production

- Adsorption Oxygen Plant - Oxygen plants are industrial systems designed to generate oxygen. They typically use air as a feedstock and separate it from other components of air using pressure swing adsorption or membrane separation techniques. Such plants are distinct from cryogenic separation plants which separate and capture all the components of air. Produces Oxygen at an increased production rate (+5 O2 p/h). Can be upgraded with Magnetic Filtering to increase the production rate (+10 O2 p/h).

- Cryogenic Oxygen Plant - A Cryogenic Oxygen Plant is an industrial facility that creates molecular oxygen at relatively high purity.  Oxygen is the most common element in the Earth's crust and the second largest industrial gas. This process was pioneered by Dr. Carl von Linde in 1902.

- In-Dome MOXIE - Dome specific MOXIE which produces Oxygen at an increased production rate (+4 O2 p/h). Production is not affected during Dust Storms. Can be upgraded with Magnetic Filtering to increase the production rate (+6 O2 p/h).

- Membrane Oxygen Plant - Oxygen plants are industrial systems designed to generate oxygen. They typically use air as a feedstock and separate it from other components of air using pressure swing adsorption or membrane separation techniques. Such plants are distinct from cryogenic separation plants which separate and capture all the components of air. Produces Oxygen at an increased production rate (+10 O2 p/h). Can be upgraded with Magnetic Filtering to increase the production rate (+15 O2 p/h).

## H2O Production

# Power Production

- Small Dome Solar Panel - The Interstellar Habitation Coalition provides you with a Dome variant of the Solar Panel.

- Large Dome Solar Panel - The Interstellar Habitation Coalition provides you with a Dome variant of the Large Solar Panel.

- High Grade Solar Array - The Interstellar Habitation Coalition provides you with a High Grade Solar Array. The effectiveness is decreased by dust accumulation and during Dust Storms. Protected from dust while turned off.

# Production

- Recycling Center - Recycling Center for outdated electronics/machine parts. Will yield exportable metals, metal, and polymers back.

# Build Area Increased

- Drone Range Increased to 50 hexes

- Dome Work Area Increased to 15 hexes

# Colonist Genetic Modification

- Colonist "Other" Gender disabled

## Save Game Compatibility 
It should be safe to install for a running game. Before removing this mod, I suggest you scrap all buildings added by this mod.
Technology unlock will take your researched technologies into account when loading a save.

## Mod Compatibility 
Most likely compatible with anything as this only adds new buildings.
