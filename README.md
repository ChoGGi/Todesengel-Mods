# ISHC2 (2.3.x)

The Interstellar Habitation Coalition has approved the necessary funding for the Mars Colony Habitation Project. This funding grants you the necessary equipment to indefinitely sustain a colony on Mars. This funding has drastically reduced the building cost for your first starter Dome however; due to the basic blueprints the upkeep has slightly been increased. The Coalition has provided unlockable blueprints and urges you to develop improved habitats at your earliest convenience.

[i] Human behavior is economic behavior. The particulars may vary but competition for limited resources remains a constant. Need as well as greed has followed us to the stars and the rewards of wealth still await those wise enough to recognize this deep thrumming of our common pulse. [/i]

[h1]Powerful management tool[/h1]
Martian Economy gives you [b] intuitive, elegant [/b] and [b] effective [/b] tools to [b] fine-tune [/b] your colony!
Have you ever wanted to restrict your Arcologies, Electronic Shops or Smart Homes to your most precious workers? Or maybe ban the non-specialists from them? 
Martian Economy lets you do [b] just that! [/b] And it's really [b] simple [/b]!

[h1]Wages, rents & prices[/h1]
With this mod your all workplaces have [b] Wage Level [/b], while Residences have [b] Rents Level [/b] and Service buildings have [b] Prices Level[/b].

Colonists will only use buildings with Prices / Rents [b] lower [/b] or [b] equal [/b] to their Wages.

Unemployed, seniors and children will [b] only use [/b] Level 1 buildings.

Also, all workers get a modifier to their [b] Comfort [/b] and [b] Morale [/b] when paid. It's [b] +/- 2 [/b] per level of difference between their Wage Level and the Dome average. So a high pay means happy and effective workers. Bad pay - the opposite.

[h1]Tips & tricks[/h1]
- Unemployed taking your [b] Smart Homes [/b]? Increase the Rent Level to 2 and watch them go away!
- Too few [b] Machine Parts [/b]? Increase the wages of factory workers and roll in them!
- Too many [b] Renegades [/b]? Need loyal security officers? Pay them good and watch their Morale raise!

## Save Game Compatibility 
It should be safe to install for a running game. Before removing this mod, I suggest you scrap all buildings added by this mod.
Technology unlock will take your researched technologies into account when loading a save.

## Mod Compatibility 
Most likely compatible with anything as this only adds new buildings.
