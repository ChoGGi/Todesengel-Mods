# ISHC2 (2.3.x)

The Interstellar Habitation Coalition has approved the necessary funding for the Mars Colony Habitation Project. This funding grants you the necessary equipment to indefinitely sustain a colony on Mars. This funding has drastically reduced the building cost for your first starter Dome however; due to the basic blueprints the upkeep has slightly been increased. The Coalition has provided unlockable blueprints and urges you to develop improved habitats at your earliest convenience.

# Domes 

Tier 1: Emergency Dome â€“ Starts unlocked

Tier 2: Medium Dome - Can be built once the Medium Dome has been researched (Low G Engineering).

Tier 3: Mega Dome - Can be built once the Mega Dome has been researched (Gravity Engineering).

Tier 4: Oval Dome - Can be built once the Oval Dome Breakthrough has been researched (Multispiral Architecture) or (Localized Terraforming Technology).

Tier 5: Geoscape Dome - Can be built once the Geoscape Dome has been researched (Localized Terraforming Technology).

## Oxygen Production

Adsorption Oxygen Plant - Oxygen plants are industrial systems designed to generate oxygen. They typically use air as a feedstock and separate it from other components of air using pressure swing adsorption or membrane separation techniques. Such plants are distinct from cryogenic separation plants which separate and capture all the components of air. Produces Oxygen at an increased production rate (+5 O2 p/h). Can be upgraded with Magnetic Filtering to increase the production rate (+10 O2 p/h).

Cryogenic Oxygen Plant - A Cryogenic Oxygen Plant is an industrial facility that creates molecular oxygen at relatively high purity.  Oxygen is the most common element in the Earth's crust and the second largest industrial gas. This process was pioneered by Dr. Carl von Linde in 1902.

Membrane Oxygen Plant - Oxygen plants are industrial systems designed to generate oxygen. They typically use air as a feedstock and separate it from other components of air using pressure swing adsorption or membrane separation techniques. Such plants are distinct from cryogenic separation plants which separate and capture all the components of air. Produces Oxygen at an increased production rate (+10 O2 p/h). Can be upgraded with Magnetic Filtering to increase the production rate (+15 O2 p/h).

# Economy
*Human behavior is economic behavior. The particulars may vary but competition for limited resources remains a constant. Need as well as greed has followed us to the stars and the rewards of wealth still await those wise enough to recognize this deep thrumming of our common pulse.* -- Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri

## Powerful management tool
Martian Economy gives you **intuitive, elegant** and **effective** tools to **fine-tune** your colony!
Have you ever wanted to restrict your Arcologies, Electronic Shops or Smart Homes to your most precious workers? Or maybe ban the non-specialists from them? 
Martian Economy lets you do **just that!** And it's really **simple**!

## Wages, rents & prices
With this mod your all workplaces have **Wage Level**, while Residences have **Rents Level** and Service buildings have **Prices Level**.

Colonists will only use buildings with Prices/Rents **lower** or **equal** to their Wages.

Unemployed, seniors and children will **only use** Level 1 buildings.

Also, all workers get a modifier to their **Comfort** and **Morale** when paid. It's **+/- 2** per level of difference between their Wage Level and the Dome average. So a high pay means happy and effective workers. Bad pay - the opposite.

## Tips & tricks
- Unemployed taking your **Smart Homes**? Increase the Rent Level to 2 and watch them go away!
- Too few **Machine Parts**? Increase the wages of factory workers and roll in them!
- Too many **Renegades**? Need loyal security officers? Pay them good and watch their Morale raise!

## Save Game Compatibility 
It should be safe to install for a running game. Before removing this mod, I suggest you scrap all buildings added by this mod.
Technology unlock will take your researched technologies into account when loading a save.

## Mod Compatibility 
Most likely compatible with anything as this only adds new buildings.
