# ISHC2 (2.3.x)

The Interstellar Habitation Coalition has approved the necessary funding for the Mars Colony Habitation Project. This funding grants you the necessary equipment to indefinitely sustain a colony on Mars. This funding has drastically reduced the building cost for your first starter Dome however; due to the basic blueprints the upkeep has slightly been increased. The Coalition has provided unlockable blueprints and urges you to develop improved habitats at your earliest convenience.

*Human behavior is economic behavior. The particulars may vary but competition for limited resources remains a constant. Need as well as greed has followed us to the stars and the rewards of wealth still await those wise enough to recognize this deep thrumming of our common pulse.*

## Powerful management tool
Martian Economy gives you **intuitive, elegant** and **effective** tools to **fine-tune** your colony!
Have you ever wanted to restrict your Arcologies, Electronic Shops or Smart Homes to your most precious workers? Or maybe ban the non-specialists from them? 
Martian Economy lets you do **just that!** And it's really **simple**!

## Wages, rents & prices
With this mod your all workplaces have **Wage Level**, while Residences have **Rents Level** and Service buildings have **Prices Level**.

Colonists will only use buildings with Prices/Rents **lower** or **equal** to their Wages.

Unemployed, seniors and children will **only use** Level 1 buildings.

Also, all workers get a modifier to their **Comfort** and **Morale** when paid. It's **+/- 2** per level of difference between their Wage Level and the Dome average. So a high pay means happy and effective workers. Bad pay - the opposite.

## Tips & tricks
- Unemployed taking your **Smart Homes**? Increase the Rent Level to 2 and watch them go away!
- Too few **Machine Parts**? Increase the wages of factory workers and roll in them!
- Too many **Renegades**? Need loyal security officers? Pay them good and watch their Morale raise!

## Save Game Compatibility 
It should be safe to install for a running game. Before removing this mod, I suggest you scrap all buildings added by this mod.
Technology unlock will take your researched technologies into account when loading a save.

## Mod Compatibility 
Most likely compatible with anything as this only adds new buildings.
